##Description 
I am a software developer learning web development. This website/project is a tool to showcase my newly learnt skill through sharing one of my hobbies, which is cooking. 

##Installation
To access the website/project, simply clone the repo and open the index.html file. The project uses Bootsrap and JQuery which are included in the project files. To access the website as an end user, simply visit [https://karabomolemane.github.io/firstWebsite/](https://karabomolemane.github.io/firstWebsite/).

##Usage

The project is a website that shared various food recipes. The user can add some of the recipes to their favourites, which will be listed on a separate page. As the user add/removes the recipes from their favourites, they are alerted on the number of items in their favourites. The user has the ablity to comment on the items they added as their favourites. The likes and comments are saved to sessionStorage.
